# AI-X-Agent
build a custom AI agent for X :

The agent should be able to create content generated by chat gpt. And as well do a series of actions related to our audience such as generate quote tweets, replies & engage with specific accounts.
-----------
To build a custom AI agent for creating content generated by ChatGPT and performing actions such as generating quote tweets, replies, and engaging with specific Twitter accounts, you can break down the task into several key components:

    Generate Content with ChatGPT:
        Use a language model (like GPT) to generate content based on predefined prompts.

    Interact with Twitter:
        Use the Twitter API (via Tweepy or Twitter API v2) to interact with the platform, such as posting tweets, replying to tweets, and quoting tweets.

    Perform Actions Related to Audience Engagement:
        Fetch the tweets of specific accounts, engage with them by replying, liking, and generating quote tweets.

Let’s implement this step-by-step in Python:
Step 1: Install Required Libraries

First, install the necessary libraries for interacting with the Twitter API and using OpenAI's GPT model for content generation:

pip install openai tweepy

Step 2: Setup OpenAI API (for Content Generation)

To use OpenAI's GPT (e.g., GPT-3 or GPT-4) to generate content, you need to have an API key. Follow these steps to get your API key:

    Sign up at https://beta.openai.com/signup/ to get your API key.
    Store the key securely (avoid hard-coding it in production code).

import openai

# Set your OpenAI API key here
openai.api_key = 'your_openai_api_key'

# Function to generate content using GPT-3 (or GPT-4)
def generate_content(prompt: str, max_tokens=100):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # You can choose GPT-4 if available
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=max_tokens,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.7,
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

Step 3: Setup Twitter API (for Engagement)

To interact with Twitter, you'll need to set up your credentials from the Twitter Developer Portal:

    Apply for a Twitter Developer account and create an app to get API keys.
    Store your credentials securely (don't hard-code in production).

Here’s how to set up the Tweepy library for Twitter API access:

import tweepy

# Set your Twitter API credentials
consumer_key = 'your_consumer_key'
consumer_secret = 'your_consumer_secret'
access_token = 'your_access_token'
access_token_secret = 'your_access_token_secret'

# Authenticate with the Twitter API
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)

# Initialize Tweepy API object
api = tweepy.API(auth)

# Function to tweet a message
def tweet(message: str):
    try:
        api.update_status(message)
        print("Tweet posted successfully!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error posting tweet: {e}")

# Function to reply to a tweet
def reply_to_tweet(tweet_id: str, message: str):
    try:
        api.update_status(message, in_reply_to_status_id=tweet_id)
        print(f"Replied to tweet ID {tweet_id}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error replying to tweet: {e}")

# Function to generate and quote a tweet
def quote_tweet(tweet_id: str, message: str):
    try:
        api.update_status(f'“{message}”', in_reply_to_status_id=tweet_id)
        print(f"Quote tweeted successfully!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error quoting tweet: {e}")

Step 4: Generate Content and Perform Actions

Now, we can combine content generation (using GPT-3/4) with the Twitter actions like replying, quoting, and engaging with specific accounts.

def generate_and_tweet(prompt: str, tweet_action="tweet", target_tweet_id=None):
    # Generate content using GPT
    generated_content = generate_content(prompt)

    # Perform the action based on user request
    if tweet_action == "tweet":
        tweet(generated_content)
    elif tweet_action == "reply" and target_tweet_id:
        reply_to_tweet(target_tweet_id, generated_content)
    elif tweet_action == "quote" and target_tweet_id:
        quote_tweet(target_tweet_id, generated_content)
    else:
        print("Invalid action or missing tweet ID.")

# Example of how to use the functions

# 1. Generate a tweet from a prompt and post it
prompt_for_tweet = "Write an inspirational quote about perseverance."
generate_and_tweet(prompt_for_tweet, tweet_action="tweet")

# 2. Generate a reply to a tweet (you would pass the tweet_id of the target tweet)
prompt_for_reply = "Reply to a tweet with a compliment about someone's work."
target_tweet_id = "tweet_id_of_target_tweet"  # Replace with actual tweet ID
generate_and_tweet(prompt_for_reply, tweet_action="reply", target_tweet_id=target_tweet_id)

# 3. Generate a quote tweet (again, use the tweet ID of the tweet you want to quote)
prompt_for_quote = "Quote tweet with a witty comment on the importance of teamwork."
generate_and_tweet(prompt_for_quote, tweet_action="quote", target_tweet_id=target_tweet_id)

Step 5: Automating Engagement

You can further automate engagement by interacting with specific Twitter accounts or certain keywords. For example, the agent could find the latest tweets from a set of target accounts, reply to them, or quote tweet them.

def engage_with_account(account_name: str, action="tweet"):
    # Get the latest tweet from a specific account
    tweets = api.user_timeline(screen_name=account_name, count=1, tweet_mode="extended")
    if not tweets:
        print(f"No tweets found for {account_name}.")
        return
    
    # Take the latest tweet
    tweet_id = tweets[0].id_str
    tweet_text = tweets[0].full_text
    
    # Generate content based on the tweet (e.g., generating a reply or quote tweet)
    prompt_for_reply = f"Respond to this tweet in a friendly manner: {tweet_text}"
    generate_and_tweet(prompt_for_reply, tweet_action=action, target_tweet_id=tweet_id)

# Engage with a specific Twitter account by replying or quoting their tweet
engage_with_account('target_account_name', action="reply")  # "reply" or "quote"

Step 6: Running the AI Agent

You can run this AI agent periodically to engage with accounts and post content. For automation, consider setting up this system to run as a scheduled job (using cron on Linux or Task Scheduler on Windows), or using a cloud-based solution to run it continuously.
Additional Features

    Target Audience Engagement:
        You can extend this by fetching tweets based on hashtags or keywords and engaging with those tweets.

    Personalization:
        Add more customization for content generation by adding context about the target audience or the goal (e.g., tweets related to specific topics).

    Monitoring:
        Implement logging or notifications to track the AI's activities and ensure everything works as expected.

Conclusion

This Python-based AI agent integrates content generation using ChatGPT with actions on Twitter, such as tweeting, replying, and quote tweeting. The code uses OpenAI’s API to generate content based on specific prompts, and the Tweepy library to interact with the Twitter platform. You can easily extend this system for automation, scheduled tasks, or deeper audience engagement.
